<!-- 
 The "authentication" tag can have a "hash" argument, with these allowed values: 
 "md5", "sha1", "sha256", "sha-256", "sha512", "sha-512"

 For example: <authentication hash="sha">

 To hash passwords for this format, run these commands:
 "md5"                    read mypass; echo -n $mypass | md5sum
 "sha" or "sha1"          read mypass; echo -n $mypass | shasum
 "sha256" or "sha-256"    read mypass; echo -n $mypass | sha256sum
 "sha512" or "sha-512"    read mypass; echo -n $mypass | sha512sum

  After changing this file, the rudder webapp must be restarted to take changes
  into account: /etc/init.d/jetty restart
