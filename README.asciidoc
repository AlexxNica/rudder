Rudder: Continuous configuration for effective compliance
---------------------------------------------------------

Rudder is an easy to use, web-driven, role-based solution for IT Infrastructure
Automation & Compliance.

The workflow offers different users options at their own level:

*  Non-expert users can define parameters in a central console, and Rudder will
   automatically make sure that your IT services are installed, configured, running
   and in good health. All actions (checks, warnings, fixed errors…) are reported upon
   immediately in the user interface, keeping drift from nominal behaviour low.
*  Expert users can configure how to implement these parameters on different systems,
   or build upon the pre-defined library provided.
*  Managers can consult compliance reports and access audit logs.

Rudder is an established project with several 10000s of node managed, in companies
from small to biggest-on-their-field. Typical deployement manages 100 to 1000 nodes.
The biggest known deployment in 2016 is 7000 nodes.

=== Feature overview

* Web interface to manage nodes and define policies
  ** https://www.rudder-project.org/site/documentation/screenshots/
* Continuously assesses drift compared to defined policies (with or without auto-healing)
* Continuously enforces configuration over time (configuring once is good,
  ensuring configuration is always valid and automatically fixing it is better)
* Inventory of all managed nodes
* Compliance reporting, by configuration and/or by node, with possibility to
  zoom on non-compliance to understand the problem.
* Automate common system administration tasks (installation, configuration)
* Full API to interact with Rudder server

=== Testing and installing Rudder

==== 5 minutes tests

===== Demo site

You can see a demo version of Rudder: http://demo.rudder-project.org/

===== Vagrant

Just want to test Rudder without worrying about a full installation, but with real
virtual machines so that you can actually configure and test things, contrary to
the demo? We provide a https://github.com/Normation/rudder-vagrant[Vagrant set-up].
See https://www.rudder-project.org/site/get-rudder/vagrant/[Rudder Vagrant page]
for a getting-started with Rudder on Vagrant.

===== Rudder Test Framework (rtf)

Rudder test framework is a tool that allows to define full environnements and set
them up for you. For example, you can define a plateform with a Rudder server on
Debian stable, 2 nodes on CentOS connected to it, and a Rudder Relay Server with
its own 2 Debian nodes with 3 lines of configuration and command.

See https://github.com/Normation/rudder-tests for more information.

==== Installing on real environments

===== Linux server packages

The easiest way to test and use Rudder for prototyping or production is to install
it from the provided Linux packages.
For the server, the main current .rpm-based (RedHat, CentOS, SLES) and .deb-based
(Debian, Ubuntu) distributions are supported. See https://www.rudder-project.org/site/get-rudder/downloads/
for details about repository and available versions.

===== Rudder agent packages

Rudder agent is extremelly versatil and packages are available for a wide set of
releases for RedHat, CentOS, SLES, Debian and Ubuntu (like RHEL3 or Debian
Lenny).

It works on other distributions as well, like Slackware, Linux for Rasperry Pi and other
embeded Linux on ARM/x86, Android, FreeBSD but no packages are provided out of
the box today.

Normation is providing commercial offer for AIX, Solaris and Windows agents.

.On a more 'developer oriented' usage on that repos only, not as Rudder as a whole:

This project is managed thanks to Maven software project management (http://maven.apache.org/).
You will have to have a working Maven 3.x.x installation.

.Clean, build and install on your local repository:

We are working on the public package repository for Rudder, so for now you will
need to build all rudder dependencies. You can create a script with the following
lines:

----
$ echo clone-build-rudder.sh
----

----
#!/bin/sh
BASE="$PWD"
REPOS="rudder-parent-pom rudder-commons scala-ldap ldap-inventory rudder"
for i in ${REPOS}; do
    echo "\e[0;32mCloning ${i}\e[0m"
    git clone https://github.com/Normation/$i.git
    P=${BASE}/${i}
    cd ${P}
    echo "\e[0;32mBuilding ${P}\e[0m"
    mvn install
done
